A ray tracer I wrote in my last semester of college in 2005. Our professor gave
us some of the utilities and the skeletons of classes, and those are retained
here as well. It read a scene from a file, but the format of the file is not
recorded. (I mean, I was in college, I didn't know about writing things down for
the future yet.) But the thing _did_ work.
